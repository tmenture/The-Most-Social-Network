# The Most Social Network

## Description:
This code is a set of API routes for a social media style website. The routes are hosted on a MongoDB database so that the website using them can grow as fast as they need to, and still be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Installation:
* Make sure you have node.js, and mongoDB installed on your machine
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Run npm init -y followed by npm i to install the required packages
* Once prior steps are completed, type npm start into the console to start the server

From here you can interact with the routes through Insomnia or similar applications.
